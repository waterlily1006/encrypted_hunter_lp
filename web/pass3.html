                        Characters in Treasure Raiders can equip 1 weapon, 3 outfit equipment, and 3 battle equipment. Besides the character's basic attributes, the weapon and 3 outfit equipment will greatly increase a character's attributes. It should be noted that the amount of attributes a character can gain by leveling up is quite limited; equipment is the key to really increasing attribute values. <br/>

                        Although battle equipment does not increase a character's attributes, it can increase battle potential. Battle potential is the standard for measuring a hunter's actual strength, but there are differences in how this potential is actually increased depending on the different character roles. For example, for Chalie, getting Enhanced Ice will greatly increase battle potential, but will do very little for Mary's battle potential.<br>
                        Character equipment quality is categorized into 4 grades: Newbie (white), Advanced (blue), Elite (purple), and Artifact (orange). The higher the quality of the equipment, the better its base attributes and the more room it has for growth. Also, different pieces of the same equipment will have differences attribute values.<br>

                        Every kind of equipment can be obtained by collecting fragments. Upon reaching a set level, each player will receive enough fragments to exchange for 1 advanced weapon. After this, players can join Dungeon Raids to gather more equipment fragments to exchange for advanced equipment.</li>

                        <h2>Treasure Raiders - Troupe Introduction</h2><br/>
                        In the world of Treasure Raiders, hunters often must join forces and complete dangerous missions together. As such, hunters began gathering into small groups, which were the predecessors of the now well-known Hunter Troupes. The Society strongly encourages hunters to create and join official Troupes. Joining a Troupe is not only a way to find more treasure hunting companions, but is also the way to challenging missions that a hunter wouldn't normally be able to complete on his/her own. Hunters will not only receive great rewards for creating a Troupe, but will also learn many practical treasure hunting skills.

                        <br/> <br/>
                        Hunters from around the world join Troupes to work towards a common purpose and create their very own treasure hunter family.

                        <br/> <br/>
                        [1. Unlocking Troupes]<br/>
                        Hunter Troupes unlocks at player level 11, and players may create their own Troupe at level 25. Players will receive the corresponding tutorial missions:<br/>
                        After completing the tutorial missions, players may join a Troupe. However, creating a Troupe requires level 25 along with a large sum of coins.

                        <br/> <br/>
                        [2. Managing a Troupe]<br/>
                        Hunter Troupes unlocks at player level 11, and players may create their own Troupe at level 25. Players will receive the corresponding tutorial missions:<br/>
                        After completing the tutorial missions, players may join a Troupe. However, creating a Troupe requires level 25 along with a large sum of coins.
                        <br/>
                        In the Troupe menu, Troupe members with the required privileges can change their Troupe Badge, manage Troupe applications, and can edit other Troupe members' roles.
                        <br/>
                        In the Rankings menu, players may view the current Hunter Rankings. If a player chooses to join a different Troupe, the contribution points he/she had from the previous Troupe will be halved. Therefore it is recommended that hunters join a Troupe that they can grow together in rather changing Troupes all the time.

                        <br/> <br/>
                        [3. Troupe Events]
                        Troupes have access to exclusive events that only members of the same Troupe can participate in: <br/>
                        The following are the different types of Troupe Events: <br/>

                        1. Troupe Contracts: daily missions that can be accepted every day at the Enigma Office. Troupe contracts are different than the regular daily missions and have star ratings. The higher the star rating, the better the rewards! <br/>  <br/>

                        2. Daily (Troupe) Targets: troupe members complete missions to reach the corresponding daily targets. After the daily target is achieved, all the troupe members will receive a reward! <br/>  <br/>

                        3.Troupe Party <br/>  <br/>

                        Troupes not only provide hunters with lots of exclusive events, but also give hunters a group which they can call home. The time of highest Troupe activity will most certainly be during the daily Troupe Party event from 20:00 to 20:10. <br/>

                        During the Troupe Party, members can share delicious food that they collected while during troupe events. Hunters will not only gain EXP from the food, but will also increase the rate at which all troupe members gain experience during the Troupe Party. Don't hog all the good food for yourself, enjoy this fun moment together with other members! <br/> <br/>

                        4. Treasure Beacon <br/>

                        Use the treasure whistle in the Troupe base to attract monsters! The hunter who summons the monsters will immediately receive a set amount of gold. After all the monsters have been defeated, members whose DPS exceeded a set percentage will receive be able to participate in grabbing a present, which contains random amounts of gold rewards! <br/>  <br/>

                        5. Troupe Order <br/>

                        This is a designated item to be turned in to Troupe Base's Materials Officer. Turn in this item to receive gold, silver, wrenches, and other rewards. In other words, you may use this event to exchange any surplus equipment or materials you have for rewards!

                        <h2>Treasure Raiders - Equipment Progress Introduction</h2><br/>


                        Players will unlock the Treasure System after reaching a specified level. One player can equip 2 Innate Treasures and 3 treasures as they choose. Innate Treasures increase the most important attributes for different classes, and the treasures that hunters may choose can be used to synergize with class characteristics. When 2 treasures that belong to the same set are equipped, a treasure skill will be unlocked, which can be used in battle.<br/>

                        Treasures can greatly increase attributes, including but not limited to Attack Power, Defense Power, HP, Healing, etc. Also, after collecting treasures of the same set, treasure skills can be used, which provides various control, regen, and escape abilities. There are also rare purple and orange treasures, which provide a stronger treasure skill. For example, Eternal Mead, which keeps your hero from dying for a time even after a fatal blow, or the Indescribable Guitar, which strengthens your items each time they are used.<br/>

                        The main ways to strengthen your treasures are Upgrades and Star Upgrades. The material required for normal upgrades is Treasure Energy Crystals, which can be obtained from the Fight Club and Treasure Trials events. Hunters can randomly receive Open Treasures of various rarities in different game modes. Treasures with a low star-rating can undergo Star Upgrades, which requires treasure shards depending on the treasure you are trying to Star Upgrade. Treasure shards can be obtained in the Fight Club and Hunter Championship events, or from some chests purchased in the store.<br/>

                        Different classes can choose treasure skills that suit their needs best, for example, a DPS focused Charlie can use the skill Earth's Embrace to increase his overall survivability. A more tanky character like Drake can use the Fetter Force Field treasure skill to slow enemy movement speed and assist friendly DPS.<br/>

                        This is a system that does not rely on topping-up, all treasure-related items cannot be traded and most items required for growing in-game is dropped via different game modes. Both paying and non-paying users must use energy to progress in this system and there is no way to simply pay and get ahead.

It is said that the ark is the earliest location of the Society's headquarters. To this day, aspiring hunters must first complete the mission of "Finding the Ark of Wonders" to enroll as a hunter. It can be said that the Ark of Wonders is where all hunters' dreams begin.<br><br/>


                        Mission Area<br/>
                        Hunters can accept a variety of missions from the Society Counter, the pool on the forward deck is for relaxing, and mysterious missions can be accepted from the cold, scary girl near the bow.<br/><br/>


                        Dispatch Area<br/>
                        Here, hunters must request permission to dispatch from Captain Aran, who provides assault ships to carry hunters to the mission areas. You may also purchase Arena Tickets from the Arena Counter on the lower deck located near the side of the ship, allowing you to participate in a series of Arena events.<br/><br/>

                        Commercial Area<br/>

                        Not only can you find Dr. Lucky, the weapons and items manufacturer here, you can also find the girl who only arrived on the Ark of Wonders a short time ago that has already become everyone's idol, Lilly. Listening to the gripes of middle-aged men might give you more useful information than you'd expect. From below the Commercial Area's deck, you can enter the Hunter Lodge, which is restricted to Hunter Troupe members.<br/><br/>


                        Hunter Lodge<br/>

                        Sit down for a drink and spend the afternoon sharing information with other treasure hunters. This is the Hunter Lodge, an exclusive place for Troupe members where many aspects of the hunter life wait to be discovered by you.<br/><br/>

                        Ruins of Rock<br/>
                        A tomb administered by the Pharaoh Rock III. Rock III has been awakened by the Ancient World to act as an "agent," taking charge of the treasures inside this tomb. He is currently working hard with his band to become famous as a lead singer and rock guitarist.<br/>
                        In the Ruins of Rock area, not only can you enjoy the authentic desert climate, you can also magnificent and mysterious remnants of the ancient civilization. But you must be careful not to disturb the chaotic inhabitants here who have no way to vent their anger other than eating you.<br/><br/>

                        Harry Boddom's Laboratory<br/>

                        This is the laboratory of the treasure energy scientist, Harry Boddom. He is sort of like the Tony Stark of the Treasure Raiders world!
                        <br/>
                        However, the laboratory seems to have taken a strange turn, as sightings of groups of unidentified people have been sighted around the lab. The doctor known for working in solitude has curiously been replaced by long-winded, frowning lab assistants. Vine can be seen growing from the lab's windows, along with tentacles that cordially spray poison as they wave at you passing by.<br/><br/>

                        Dracula's Castle<br/>

                        The recommended expedition point in Hunter Weekly appears to only be an old, run-down manor. However, after crossing the cemetery and pumpkin patches in front of the castle, perhaps another world is waiting for you inside?!<br/>
                        It's good to have the spirit of adventure, of course, but as a guest, you must be careful of your manners and mindful of the master. You wouldn't want anything bad to happen if there is no way to leave the house until dawn...<br/><br/>

                        <h2>Charles Hunter</h2> <br/>

                        "Let's go, Mr. Voltaire!"  <br/><br/>

                        A young machinist aspiring to become a treasure hunter. His character is gentle and kind, but a bit slow when it comes to understanding relationships...<br/>

                        When Charlie was 10 years old, his father left after giving Charlie a mysterious gauntlet. He has never heard from his father since. To find out the truth behind his father's disappearance, Charlie grew up to become an apprentice treasure hunter on a journey to the Ark of Wonders with his loyal companion, Mr. Voltaire. Perhaps there are more friends for Charlie to meet along the way...

                        <br/><br/>

                        Character Role<br/>
                        Charlie infused the Power Gauntlet on his right arm with treasure energy, giving the gauntlet "elemental" properties and making it no ordinary weapon! With varying elemental types, Charlie can be the both team's cool "Frost Control" or the explosive "Electric Zapper."
                        <br/>

                        Using the ice element as his primary weapon and equipment, Charlie wields freezing and slow effects, allowing him to stop the enemy in their tracks at a crucial moment. He may even interrupt boss abilities and control the flow of the battle. In PvP, Charlie can limit the enemy's ability to move, providing him and his teammates an opportunity to unleash their DPS.
                        <br/>

                        With electric weapons and equipment, Charlie can attack large amounts of enemies, which is effective when being surrounded or needing to clear a path through enemies. In PvP, Charlie will have high DPS and burst damage capable of granting a quick victory over the enemy.
                        <br/>

                        <br/><br/>

                        Character Weapons<br/>
                        ·Elemental Rifle<br/>

                        A steady and reliable DPS weapon, after using his Power Gauntlet to charge up, Charlie can fire bullets that have ice elemental properties.<br/><br/>

                        ·Plasma Gun<br/>
                        The electric arcs that are emitted from the Plasma Gun conduct electricity between enemies in range, dealing AOE damage. If the enemy is trying to bully you with their numbers, let the Plasma Gun teach them how to behave!<br/><br/>

                        Battle Equipment<br/>
                        ·Ice Grenade<br/>
                        Freezes enemies at the center of its explosion radius and causes enemies in range to have 5 layers of "frost" effect. This causes movement speed to be slow and increases chances of crit when dealt ice damage.<br/><br/>

                        ·EM Grenade<br/>
                        When the grenade explodes, it will create an area of EM charge, dealing continuous electric attacks to enemies in range.<br/>

                        ·Voltaire's Frost Cannon<br/>

                        Summon Mr. Voltaire with his cannon. Each time the cannon hits an enemy, it will add a "Frost" status, slowing movement speed and increasing crit chances from ice damage. "Frost" status can be stacked up to 5 times.<br/><br/>

                        ·Voltaire's E Turret<br/>
                        Summon Mr. Voltaire to operate an electrical tower that will continuously attack nearby units, dealing a paralysis effect.<br/><br/>

                        ·Holo Projector<br/>
                        Summon an illusion to assist in battle. The illusion's HP and attack values are a little lower than yours.<br/><br/>

                        ·Power Gauntlet<br/>
                        A mysterious weapon left behind by Charlie's father. It charges up by absorbing treasure energy and fires a bolt of lightning once fully charged.<br/><br/>

                        <h2>Drake </h2><br/>

                        "Did you just try to touch my butt?!"  <br/>

                        Appearing to be just the average unreliable womanizer wearing a woman's cowboy hat, Drake is actually an S level Society hunter! Deep down though, he seems to be keeping some important matter to himself.  <br/>

                        On the way to the City of Hunters, the transport that Charlie was riding on came under attack from the Plunder Platoon. Luckily, Drake was also riding that transport, who then used his experience to help command Charlie in battle, defeating the Plunder Platoon attackers. It didn't take long for Drake's unreliable side to become apparent, but Charlie continued to help him through a slew of challenges together. After exposing the Plunder Platoon's plot to bring about the Fall of Civilization, not only did facts about Drake's past begin to surface, Charlie was able to find more clues regarding his father...    <br/><br/>

                        Character Role<br/>

                        Drake is considered the team's tank, soaking up most of the incoming damage with his huge HP and defense. His Adrenaline and Exoskeleton equipment ensure his survivability while his Smash Hammer effectively controls enemy bosses and disrupts enemy DPS.
                        <br/>
                        When training Drake to be a tank, hunters should focus on increasing his HP, DEF, and elemental resistance. Remember to prioritize these three attributes when modifying items as well. Of course, attack and movement speed should also be taken into consideration when preparing Drake for PvP game modes.
                        <br/><br/>

                        Character Weapons

                        To let Drake's ability to absorb damage really shine, hunters can try equipping Drake's Shotgun or Heavy Machinegun as a weapon together with items like Rocket Boots, Smash Hammer, Adrenaline, Exoskeleton, and Chainsaw Tornado.<br/><br/>

                        ·Shotgun: A weapon that tears through enemies at close range. Combined with Drake's undeniably good looks, your enemies will most certainly despise you.<br/><br/>

                        ·Heavy Machineguns: Guns that put out massive single-target damage and makes iron walls look like paper! The one minor setback is that movement speed is slowed when attacking, and healing takes more time.<br/><br/>

                        ·Rocket Boots: Use the speed of your rocket boots to blast forward, dealing massive damage to any enemies hit along the way.<br/><br/>

                        ·Smash Hammer: swing your massive hammer into the ground, stunning nearby units and dealing a set amount of damage.<br/><br/>

                        ·Adrenaline: believe in the miracles of overwhelming strength and receive a metal bodyfor a short time. The moment you transform, nearby enemies will be knocked back, your bullets will be more effective, and you will receive a large amount of HP for a short duration.<br/><br/>

                        ·Heroic Leap: Drake jumps high into the air and then smashes into the specified location, dealinghigh damage and increasing Drake's DEF.<br/><br/>

                        ·Exoskeleton: summons an outer shell and deals large AOE damage each time Drake smashes the ground. Drake's Exoskeleton can help him absorb a large amount of damage.<br/><br/>

                        ·Chainsaw Tornado: Drake starts spinning with a chainsaw until he becomes like a tornado, dealing AOE damage and disrupting nearby enemies.<br/><br/>

                        “ヾ (o ° ω ° O ) ノ”  <br/>
                        Harry Boddom was originally an expert on treasure research, both rich and handsome, and quite the playboy. But after his arch rival managed to find a way to transform him into a baby, he began to reflect back on his life. As a single, 10 month old baby, Harry pilots a mech that he created and has now become a treasure hunter, looking for a way to return to his former self.<br/> <br/>

                        Character Role<br/>

                        Dr. Harry is able to switch between DPS and DEF capabilities. His tough mech provides him with reliable survivability and he has various items to help bolster his defense, allowing him to charge ahead of the team. At the same time, Harry can use close-range flamethrowers or long range rifles to dish out DPS. Harry is a well-rounded tank and damage dealer.<br/>

                        "Defense Line" allows Harry to deal consistent and considerable DPS, and his heat-seeking rockets will definitely upset the enemy. Coupled with Harry's blinding Flashbang and high DEF, high definitely serves an important role on the battlefield. In PvP, his survivability and versatility give him considerable combat potential.<br/>

                        The "Damage Build" primarily consists of the flamethrower's AOE damage. Similar to how Charlie can use ice or electrical damage, Dr. Boddom can use fire elemental damage to add a burning effect to the enemy. Along with items like Fuel Thrower, Air Support, etc., playing as Dr. Boddom will give the satisfying feeling of bombarding the enemy with damage. In PvP, be sure to level up the burning effects for powerful results.<br/><br/>

                        ·Akimbo Rifles<br/>

                        Character Items<br/>

                        ·Flashbang<br/>
                        A modified form of the flashbang grenade used by police forces that blinds affected units. Who woulda guessed that even robot dog eyes made of titanium alloy can be blinded...<br/><br/>

                        ·Frag Shield<br/>

                        Generate a shield to block damage for yourself that explodes either upon taking too much damage or when its time limit is reached, dealing damage to nearby enemies.<br/><br/>

                        ·Missile Array<br/>

                        Casts a force field around the user that bounces back any enemies that draw near to it. Allies within the force field will receive a set amount of damage reduction.<br/><br/>

                        ·Air Support<br/>

                        Failing to stop the Fall of Civilization caused the Society to greatly increase support for its treasure hunters. Simply call the Society for support to bombard the area in front of you.

                        The "monster" inside.<br/>

                        When she is Mariko, she is just a shy archaeologist, rushing about to different archaeological digs to complete her homework. When she is Mary, she is a ruthless treasure hunter with a fiery temper with a single mission: find out the truth about Operation TS_07 from 10 years before. By complete chance, Mariko was saved by Charlie, and she has been in love with Charlie ever since. However, she can never seem to find the right moment to tell him. There are many twists and turns on the road called love, but Mary has absolutely no interest in Charlie at all, and simply orders Charlie around to complete her missions.  <br/> <br/>

                        Character Role<br/>

                        An explosive girl that blows away any enemy that gets in her way; possesses high DPS potential. Whether using a "damage build" to annhilate large groups of enemies, or a "focused build" to take down bosses, she is always an essential pick for any team that needs to deal damage.<br/>

                        The "damage build" primarily consists of Auto Rifles along with grenades and missles, capable of dealing massive damage to groups of enemies. The very sound of her Gatling Gun will strike fear into her enemies. Her shield is capable of blocking damage and make up for her lack of high HP. In PvP, if you unleash her DPS at the right moment, you will make quick work of any enemy in your way. <br/>

                        The "focused build" primarily consists of the long-range Sniper Rifle that allows her to take out enemies from a distance, along with Octopus Shurikens, and Spider Mines to keep enemies from getting too close. Her ultimate single-target weapon, the Rupturator, is a great choice against bosses. In PvP, using her superior range to stay at a distance and advancing slowly is the key to victory. <br/> <br/>

                        Throw 3 darts that damage and silence the enemy. If the darts do not hit any walls or obstacles, they will return after reaching their maximum range, dealing their attack effect to enemies hit along the way.<br/> <br/>

                        · Reaper<br/>

                        "There is no mission impossible for me to complete!"<br/>

                        When she is wearing the cape, she is the rising star of the Hunters Society. No one knows her true identity because she always completes missions alone. Without the cape, she is a noble girl born into a rich family whose grandfather was once president of the Society. However, her grandfather was forced to quit that position because of the failure of Operation TS_07, and he never revealed the truth behind the incident. To restore her family's name, she has become a treasure hunter incognito and is on her own mission to investigate Operation TS_07.
                        <br/>
                        The Silver Seeker has a prideful attitude and despite her polite words, she quite enjoys patronizing others. Her work ethic covers up her frail heart and actually desires to be supported by others in the team. <br/>

                        Character Role<br/>

                        Always equipped with a variety of medical items, Silver Seeker excels at healing other team members. Depending on different situations, Silver Seeker can choose between "buff build" for healing teammates and increasing their battle potential, or the "healing build," which increases survivability.<br/><br/>

                        When choosing the "buff build," Silver Seeker should primarily equip her Hand Cannon and Amphetamines. When she uses her hand cannon to attack enemies, it will leave behind a healing circle which heals nearby allies, essentially taking care of two birds with one stone. Amphetamines will greatly increase teammate's damage output for a short duration and are the signal for the team to concentrate their firepower on the enemy. In PvP, the Silver Seeker's survivability is her greatest weapon.<br/><br/>


                        When choosing the "healing build," Silver Seeker doesn't have any DPS capabilities, so it is typically a more PvE oriented build. Her MedGun has exponential healing capabilities compared to her Hand Cannon and can let her teammates focus on DPS without worrying about taking too much damage. MedBots and her other Meds can help strengthen her healing effects.<br/><br/>

                        Character Weapons<br/><br/>

                        ·Hand Cannon<br/>

                        An elegant and noble weapon that uses special bullets capable of damaging the enemy while healing her allies. However, it is said that the only difference between these bullets and others is that they added some tea powder inside???<br/><br/>

                        ·MedGun

                        The MedGun shoots out a healing wave that can heal multiple allied units simultaneously. Please note that the MedGun has no damage effect on the enemy.<br/><br/>

                        Character Items<br/>

                        ·Energy Grenade<br/>

                        It was once thought that there was little purpose for such a weak grenade, but it instead has found its place among medics on the battlefield. These grenades are capable of flying far at a slow speed, dealing a set amount of damage to enemies hit along the way.<br/><br/>

                        ·MedBots<br/>

                        Summon a MedBot and it will automatically lock onto and follow the most wounded ally, leaving you carefree until daybreak.<br/><br/>

                        <h2>"Ruins Raid" Boss Hungry Mummy - Details</h2>  <br/>
                        Challenge Dungeons is Treasure Hunters' main co-op event. Hunters can choose from the "normal" or "elite" difficulties. Entries for normal dungeons refresh every day, and elite dungeon entries refreshes weekly.

The different styles and types of each dungeon will most certainly leave hardcore treasure hunters asking for more. After clearing each type of dungeon, hunters have a chance of receiving equipment fragments, elite equipment, and big rewards! Gather your fellow treasure hunters and use your combat skills and quick ingenuity to win honor for the team!<br/> <br/>

                        Boss Skills and Strategy<br/> <br/>

                        The team needs to bring a tough tank to get the boss' attention and cause the boss to jump towards the tank and not other members.<br/>
                        DPS and healing need to quickly move out of the range of that skill and shouldn't be standing near the tank at that time.<br/>
                        After the skill is finished, the team's healer needs to quickly heal up any allies that took damage.<br/> <br/>

                        Strategy:<br/>
                        This skill is extremely fast and difficult to dodge, so it will require players to use their HP to take the hit.
                        After the ability ends, the healer will have to help the team get back on its feet and recover HP.<br/> <br/>

                        Skill Description: Hungry Mummy slap its chest and unleashes its power, drawing all enemies nearby it and spinning to hit them.<br/> <br/>

                        Skill Description: after the mummy has been reduced below 50% HP, it will enter the 2nd stage and start launching missile zombies. These little zombies will target a treasure hunter and launch missiles that deal large AOE damage.<br/> <br/>

                        Strategy: concentrate firepower to eliminate the zombies and if a teammate is being targeted, other teammates should move away.<br/> <br/>

                        Stage 3 Summon Monsters<br/>
                        Skill Description: Hungry Mummy slap its chest and unleashes its power, drawing all enemies nearby it and spinning to hit them.<br/> <br/>

                        <h2>Treasure Hunters Racing Event Introduction</h2>  <br/>
                        There are some special events in Treasure Hunters, such as the Racing Game and Energy Crisis. The rewards are based on performance and the rules are a bit more complicated. Once hunters understand the rules and how to play, their chances of getting better rewards will be much greater. We will go into some more detail regarding these special events, in hope that more hunters will be able to enjoy the events!
                        <br/> <br/>
                        Level Restriction: Lvl 20 - 80<br/>
                        Event Type: Teams of 2 - 4 hunters<br/>
                        Event Time: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 20:15 to 21:00<br/>
                        The Racing Game is an event where players race to kill the boss. Hunters can team up in groups of 4 to challenge the event. Each day, 3 chances to enter this event are given to hunters and the best score of these 3 chances will be counted as the score for the day.<br/>
                        It should be noted that the boss will have different characteristics each time this event is opened, so the team and playstyle should be adjusted each time to get the highest amount damage possible.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        As above, the Pharaoh boss receives 15% more physical damage, so it would be a good idea for more teams to pick Mary to fight him.<br/>
                        Below are the bosses that might appear:
                        Pharaoh: receives 15% more physical damage.<br/>
                        Hungry Mummy: receives 15% more fire damage.<br/>
                        Don Carrotti's Coniglio Squad: shared HP pool.<br/>
                        Don Carrotti: immune to crit damage.<br/>
                        The boss must be defeated within 2 minutes. If hunters are unable to defeat the boss in that amount of time, then rewards will be given based on the percentage of the boss' HP that was damaged. Also, the team's damage dealt will be recorded in the rankings and players with higher rankings will earn more rare rewards.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        So now you probably get the idea of the Racing Game... Bring more damage! But does that man you can 1st place by bringing 4 DPS hunters? The boss has 10 layers of HP, when the boss has 8 layers remaining, it will enter a frenzied state, and each layer destroyed after that will only increase its effects. After 1 layer of HP is destroyed while the boss is in a frenzy, its damage will be too much for any DPS hunter to bear. Therefore, it is recommended that the team has a reliable tank and healer to help the DPS characters survive longer.

                        The Twin Star Arena is a doubles style event where 2 hunters climb a tower with 18 levels of challenges. There will be 9 levels available when the server opens, 12 levels available on the 2nd day, 15 levels available on the 4th day, and 18 levels available on the 6th day. Hunters will face elite monsters on levels 3/9/15, and will face a boss on levels 6/12/18. Elite or boss levels are spawn points where hunters can respawn and continue the challenge. The higher the level reached, the greater the rewards.<br/> <br/>

                        Because the event is limited to teams of 2, it is difficult to balance DPS and survivability. The most reliable team is undoubtedly 1 DPS plus 1 healer. Teams that are more confident in their abilities may try choosing 2 DPS characters, or 1 DPS and 1 tank.<br/>
                        If hunters take more than 90 seconds on any given stage, the monsters will enter an ancient fury status, greatly increasing their damage. Players should work to eliminate all the monsters quickly.

                        <h2>Holo Exercise</h2><br/>
                        Holo Exercises are solo events that are unlocked at lvl 12. Hunters can reach lvl 11 through the main storyline and once they've completed The Countess's Favor mission, this gamemode will be unlocked. <br/><br/>

                        Hunters can open the Holo Exercises menu by speaking with the Elegant Countess in the castle.<br/><br/>
                        As players progress through the storyline, more and more Holo Exercise levels will become available. When players successfully complete one of the holo levels, they can try challenging the next level. Each holo level has a recommended attack power. Players must pick the holo levels suited to their own attack power. Also, failing a level does not deduct from a hunter's entry count, so they may try as many times as they like.<br/><br/>

                        After entering a holo exercise, players will find themselves in a sealed area surrounded by many attacking enemies. After each wave of enemies is defeated, the holo exercise's progress amount will increase:<br/><br/>


                        When all enemies are defeated, the holo exercise will be completed. Hunters can obtain treasure rewards from completing holo exercises, including Treasure Energy Crystals, as well as rare and epic items. There is a bonus reward for the 1st time each holo level is cleared.<br/><br/>

                        <h2>Treasure Hunters Base Defense Introduction</h2><br/>

                        Out of all the exciting events in Treasure Hunters, the one that hunters most look forward to must be Base Defense. Two teams fight through a narrow map in close range combat, fighting hard to make their way forward. There will be intense team fights, skill synergies, and incredible battles that will leave you wanting to try again!
                        <br/><br/>
                        During Base Defense, teams of 4 hunters will be paired up with another team of 4 and then will battle another group of 8 hunters in a massive red vs blue battle. Each team has defensive towers and base; whichever team's base has more remaining HP at the end of the battle will win. Before the towers are destroyed, the base will be invulnerable. If you destroy the enemy base, you will be immediately declared the winners!<br/><br/>


                        There are emergency kits behind the base and towers to increase ammunition and recover HP. The defending side can use these resources to defend more effectively. However, it is not good if the enemy team manages to take these resources, so be sure to do your best to keep that from happening.
