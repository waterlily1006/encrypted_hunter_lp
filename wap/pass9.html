        Mariko and Mary</h3><br> <br> 
          <p style="font-size:.09rem;color:#834813;line-height:0.15rem;">
				
			
				"Mama always said that no matter what the situation, it's important to act like a lady... Now get your filthy hands off of me you pervert!"<br> <br> 

				The "monster" inside.<br> 
				When she is Mariko, she is just a shy archaeologist, rushing about to different archaeological digs to complete her homework. When she is Mary, she is a ruthless treasure hunter with a fiery temper with a single mission: find out the truth about Operation TS_07 from 10 years before. By complete chance, Mariko was saved by Charlie, and she has been in love with Charlie ever since. However, she can never seem to find the right moment to tell him. There are many twists and turns on the road called love, but Mary has absolutely no interest in Charlie at all, and simply orders Charlie around to complete her missions.<br> <br> 

				Character Role<br> 
				An explosive girl that blows away any enemy that gets in her way; possesses high DPS potential. Whether using a "damage build" to annhilate large groups of enemies, or a "focused build" to take down bosses, she is always an essential pick for any team that needs to deal damage.
				The "damage build" primarily consists of Auto Rifles along with grenades and missles, capable of dealing massive damage to groups of enemies. The very sound of her Gatling Gun will strike fear into her enemies. Her shield is capable of blocking damage and make up for her lack of high HP. In PvP, if you unleash her DPS at the right moment, you will make quick work of any enemy in your way.<br> 
				The "focused build" primarily consists of the long-range Sniper Rifle that allows her to take out enemies from a distance, along with Octopus Shurikens, and Spider Mines to keep enemies from getting too close. Her ultimate single-target weapon, the Rupturator, is a great choice against bosses. In PvP, using her superior range to stay at a distance and advancing slowly is the key to victory.<br> <br> 

				Character Weapons<br> 
				·Assault Rifle<br> <br> 

				A steady and reliable single-target DPS weapon that can shoot at range. This weapon is capable of dealing with any situation and is the first pick for hunters that like a good fight!<br> <br> 

				·Sniper Rifle<br> 
				<br> 
				Fires on the target area from a distance and deals massive damage after tapping and holding to charge up the weapon. Projectiles from this weapon are capable of hitting all enemies along the way to the target, making it great for sweeping away crowds of enemies!<br> <br> 

				Battle Equipment<br> 
				·Frag Grenade<br> <br> 
				<br> 
				Toss a grenade that explodes and deals large damage, leaving the blast area burning with fire.<br> <br> 

				·Spider Mine<br> 
				<br> 
				Bury a couple of Spider Mines automatically track enemies.<br> 
				<br> 
				·Octopus Shuriken<br> 
				<br> 
				Throw 3 darts that damage and silence the enemy. If the darts do not hit any walls or obstacles, they will return after reaching their maximum range, dealing their attack effect to enemies hit along the way.<br> <br> 

				· Reaper<br> 
				<br> 
				Temporarily switch your weapon for the Reaper Rocket Launcher until you run out of rocket ammo. You'd better make those 3 shots count!<br> <br> 

				·Gatling<br> 
				<br> 
				Temporarily switch your weapon for the Gatling Gun, taking care of any enemies you might have accidentally left standing.<br> <br> 

				·Rupturator<br> 
				<br> 
				Use this energy beam weapon to fire a penetrating laser beam, continuously dealing large damage to any enemies in your path.
