           Equipment Progress Introduction</h3><br> <br> 
<p style="font-size:.09rem;color:#834813;line-height:0.15rem;">
Characters in Treasure Raiders can equip 1 weapon, 3 outfit equipment, and 3 battle equipment. Besides the character's basic attributes, the weapon and 3 outfit equipment will greatly increase a character's attributes. It should be noted that the amount of attributes a character can gain by leveling up is quite limited; equipment is the key to really increasing attribute values.<br> <br> 
Although battle equipment does not increase a character's attributes, it can increase battle potential. Battle potential is the standard for measuring a hunter's actual strength, but there are differences in how this potential is actually increased depending on the different character roles. For example, for Chalie, getting Enhanced Ice will greatly increase battle potential, but will do very little for Mary's battle potential.<br> <br> 

Character equipment quality is categorized into 4 grades: Newbie (white), Advanced (blue), Elite (purple), and Artifact (orange). The higher the quality of the equipment, the better its base attributes and the more room it has for growth. Also, different pieces of the same equipment will have differences attribute values.<br> <br> 
Every kind of equipment can be obtained by collecting fragments. Upon reaching a set level, each player will receive enough fragments to exchange for 1 advanced weapon. After this, players can join Dungeon Raids to gather more equipment fragments to exchange for advanced equipment.<br> <br> 
Character items can be modified by NPC Dr. Lucky, who is located in the main city. Players may also simply tap the "Laboratory" button to jump there quickly.
There 4 different ways to further progress your equipment: upgrades, embedding gems, recalibration, and infusion.<br> <br> 

· Upgrades<br> <br> 


·Embedding Gems<br> 
For every gem added using the embed function, weapon attack power will increase by 3% and an equipment's base stats will increase by 3%. Weapons and items of higher quality will be able to embed more gems. Once an item is embedded with 10 gems, a special glow effect will be activated, allowing you to stand out in battle! Embedded gems can be removed from equipment for free.<br> <br> 

·Recalibration<br> 
Recalibration will cause a weapon's stats to greatly change. Equipment that has never been recalibrated will always only have 2 base stats. After calibrating once, the equipment will have 5 or more base stats, causing its potential to greatly increase. The resulting stats from calibration will be random each time. There is a pentagram icon before each stat that is either gold, silver, or bronze in color. These colors represent how important each of these stats is to the current character. Players can repeatedly recalibrate items, and while recalibrating, if a battle potential with higher values than the current battle potential is achieved, tap the "Replace Stats" button to apply the stats to the piece of equipment.
The material required for recalibration is relic metals and recalibrating artifacts will require special treasure shards.<br> <br> 

·Infusion<br> 
Infusion can add new attributes for a piece of equipment and requires the equipment's corresponding essence and silver. There are white, blue, purple, and gold qualities of essence; the higher the quality, the higher the value of the added stats. The stats added by different types of essence is random, for example, weapon essence has a chance of adding special attack effects. Hunters can infuse their equipment with the essence that best fits the role of their character, and can compare the battle potential from before and after infusion to decide whether or not they would like to use the new infused effects. Hunters can obtain essence from events or by exchanging mini-essence. To obtain mini-essence, players can disassemble low-quality equipment or equipment not suitable for infusion. After collecting a certain amount of mini-essence, hunters can exchange for higher quality infusion materials.
