          Treasure Raiders - Troupe Introduction</h3><br> <br> 
<p style="font-size:.09rem;color:#834813;line-height:0.15rem;">In the world of Treasure Raiders, hunters often must join forces and complete dangerous missions together. As such, hunters began gathering into small groups, which were the predecessors of the now well-known Hunter Troupes. The Society strongly encourages hunters to create and join official Troupes. Joining a Troupe is not only a way to find more treasure hunting companions, but is also the way to challenging missions that a hunter wouldn't normally be able to complete on his/her own. Hunters will not only receive great rewards for creating a Troupe, but will also learn many practical treasure hunting skills.<br>  
Hunters from around the world join Troupes to work towards a common purpose and create their very own treasure hunter family.<br>  <br>  

[1. Unlocking Troupes] <br>   
Hunter Troupes unlocks at player level 11, and players may create their own Troupe at level 25. Players will receive the corresponding tutorial missions:<br> 

After completing the tutorial missions, players may join a Troupe. However, creating a Troupe requires level 25 along with a large sum of coins.<br>  <br>  

[2. Managing a Troupe]<br>  
After joining a Troupe, players can view their Troupe by tapping the Troupe button.<br>   

In the Troupe menu, Troupe members with the required privileges can change their Troupe Badge, manage Troupe applications, and can edit other Troupe members' roles.<br>  

In the Rankings menu, players may view the current Hunter Rankings. If a player chooses to join a different Troupe, the contribution points he/she had from the previous Troupe will be halved. Therefore it is recommended that hunters join a Troupe that they can grow together in rather changing Troupes all the time.<br>  <br>  

[3. Troupe Events]<br>  
Troupes have access to exclusive events that only members of the same Troupe can participate in:<br>  
The following are the different types of Troupe Events:<br>  
1. Troupe Contracts: daily missions that can be accepted every day at the Enigma Office. Troupe contracts are different than the regular daily missions and have star ratings. The higher the star rating, the better the rewards!<br> <br> 
2. Daily (Troupe) Targets: troupe members complete missions to reach the corresponding daily targets. After the daily target is achieved, all the troupe members will receive a reward!<br>  <br>
3.Troupe Party<br>  
Troupes not only provide hunters with lots of exclusive events, but also give hunters a group which they can call home. The time of highest Troupe activity will most certainly be during the daily Troupe Party event from 20:00 to 20:10.<br>  
During the Troupe Party, members can share delicious food that they collected while during troupe events. Hunters will not only gain EXP from the food, but will also increase the rate at which all troupe members gain experience during the Troupe Party. Don't hog all the good food for yourself, enjoy this fun moment together with other members!<br><br>
4. Treasure Beacon<br>  
Use the treasure whistle in the Troupe base to attract monsters! The hunter who summons the monsters will immediately receive a set amount of gold. After all the monsters have been defeated, members whose DPS exceeded a set percentage will receive be able to participate in grabbing a present, which contains random amounts of gold rewards!<br>  <br>
5. Troupe Order<br>  
This is a designated item to be turned in to Troupe Base's Materials Officer. Turn in this item to receive gold, silver, wrenches, and other rewards. In other words, you may use this event to exchange any surplus equipment or materials you have for rewards! </p>
