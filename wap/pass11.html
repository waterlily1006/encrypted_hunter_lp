					Welcome to the world of Treasure Hunters! My name's Lilly, I take care of the shop on the Ark of Wonders.<br> 
					After rigorous beta testing, Treasure Hunters is finally ready for everyone to play! This is the moment you've been waiting for! Lilly takes care of the shop each day and has been dreaming of the sight of so many new hunters coming onboard (starry-eyed)!<br> 
					With it being just your first time onboard, I'm sure many of you have some questions regarding how to become better hunters. No problem, Lilly can help get you on your way. So listen carefully!<br> <br> 

					[1. Select Your Character]
					<br> <br> 
					To enter the world of Treasure Hunters, you must first pick a type of character that best suits you. Let's see what we have to choose from!
					Charlie: yeah this is the guy you see in all the Treasure Hunters pictures. Mr. Charlie is skilled at controlling the elements and machinery, capable of high DPS, and is an essential part of any team that needs to deal some serious damage. 
					Drake: an old uncle who's always positive and optimistic. He's got loads of experience and is usually responsible for soaking up all that tasty damage from the enemy.<br> 
					Mary: at first glance, she definitely appears to be a kind and sweet young lady, but as soon as the fight starts she turns into a bloodthirsty blonde of violence whose ferocity leaves the enemy shuddering. Let Little Sunflower tell ya, once she gets rolling, there's nothing that can stop her.<br> 
					Harry Boddom: that's right, this cute little baby piloting the mecha is Dr. Harry. This little dude is a versatile warrior, capable of AOE damage, as well as a more defensive setup.<br> 
					Silver Seeker: an elegant and beautiful young lady. Miss Silver Seeker fills the key support role for the team, providing constant healing and increasing allies' combat potential!<br> <br> 

					I'm sure that by this point you've already chosen which character you'd like to play! So let's start our Treasure Hunter adventure, shall we!<br> <br> 

					[2. Guide to Understanding the Game]
					<br> <br> 
					We've just entered the world of Treasure Hunters and we are already facing a crisis?! Don't worry, just follow the storyline and enjoy the ride!
					<br> <br> 
					Following the game's newbie guide, new hunters can learn how to control their characters as well as how to use different gamemodes and equipment. Believe me, you'll be an expert treasure hunter before you know it!<br> 
					Little Sunflower is a HUGE fan of Miss Mary... Here we will have Miss Mary give us a little demonstration. (Mary: Let's get this over with, my time is limited, you know!)<br> <br> 

					[3. Level Up for More Surprises]
					<br> <br> 
					The panel on the left will display your current missions and above that, you will see recently unlocked game modes and features. We just make too easy for you!
					As continue leveling up, you will keep unlocking new gamemodes and game mechanics. The massive world of treasure hunters is waiting to be explored!<br> <br> 

					[4. Collecting Your Equipment Over Time]<br> <br> 
					
					Hunters can equip up to 1 weapon, 3 combat items, and 3 outfit items. Try changing these items around to make a unique character of your own!
					<br> <br> 
					As hunters level up, they'll gain more access to the Laboratory, weapons, and equipment. They'll also be able level up items, embed gems, recalibrate weapons, and infuse upgrades. Items can also be modified and hunters can produce their own items! There are endless possibilities with each piece of equipment!<br> 
					If you'd like to try out new equipment, remember to visit Lilly's shop. She has different kinds of weapons, clothing, and items for you to check out!<br> <br> 

					[5. Make Friends and Battle Together]
					<br> <br> 
					The world of Treasure Hunters is full of adventure, there's no point in experiencing it all on your own. Join together with other players and form a team to take on greater challenges.<br> 
					Little Sunflower recommends that everyone on the ark look for other companions who share the same spirit of adventure. Chat with others, fight monsters, and share the joy of a successful mission! Little Sunflower can only be satisfied when she sees smiles on everyone's faces, ya know!<br> <br> 

					[6. New Events Every Day]
					<br> <br> 
					The Society is hard at work finding events to keep everyone at the top of their treasure hunting game... And the events are fun!<br> 
					There are different gamemodes available on the ark each day. If you wish to experience all of them, you'll have to be sure to get online often and work with your teammates!<br> <br> 

					Whew... I've said a lot now... Well, I hope Little Sunflower has helped everyone on their first steps towards becoming the next great treasure hunters!
					Do you still have more questions? No problem, you can follow our official Facebook page:<br> 
					Feel free to let us know if you have any questions or suggestions, Little Sunflower and the Society members will read your comments and work to make the world Treasure Hunters a better experience for everyone.<br> 
					So now that we've made it this far, Little Sunflower's got a gift for you! I'll see you all again soon! (waves~)<br>
