			"Let's go, Mr. Voltaire!"<br> <br> 

			A young machinist aspiring to become a treasure hunter. His character is gentle and kind, but a bit slow when it comes to understanding relationships...
			When Charlie was 10 years old, his father left after giving Charlie a mysterious gauntlet. He has never heard from his father since. To find out the truth behind his father's disappearance, Charlie grew up to become an apprentice treasure hunter on a journey to the Ark of Wonders with his loyal companion, Mr. Voltaire. Perhaps there are more friends for Charlie to meet along the way...<br> <br> 

			Character Role<br> 
			Charlie infused the Power Gauntlet on his right arm with treasure energy, giving the gauntlet "elemental" properties and making it no ordinary weapon! With varying elemental types, Charlie can be the both team's cool "Frost Control" or the explosive "Electric Zapper."<br> 
			Using the ice element as his primary weapon and equipment, Charlie wields freezing and slow effects, allowing him to stop the enemy in their tracks at a crucial moment. He may even interrupt boss abilities and control the flow of the battle. In PvP, Charlie can limit the enemy's ability to move, providing him and his teammates an opportunity to unleash their DPS.
			With electric weapons and equipment, Charlie can attack large amounts of enemies, which is effective when being surrounded or needing to clear a path through enemies. In PvP, Charlie will have high DPS and burst damage capable of granting a quick victory over the enemy.<br> <br> 

			Character Weapons<br> 
			·Elemental Rifle<br> 
			A steady and reliable DPS weapon, after using his Power Gauntlet to charge up, Charlie can fire bullets that have ice elemental properties.<br> <br> 

			·Plasma Gun<br> 
			The electric arcs that are emitted from the Plasma Gun conduct electricity between enemies in range, dealing AOE damage. If the enemy is trying to bully you with their numbers, let the Plasma Gun teach them how to behave!<br> <br> 

			Battle Equipment<br> 
			·Ice Grenade<br> 
			Freezes enemies at the center of its explosion radius and causes enemies in range to have 5 layers of "frost" effect. This causes movement speed to be slow and increases chances of crit when dealt ice damage.<br> <br> 

			·EM Grenade<br> 
			When the grenade explodes, it will create an area of EM charge, dealing continuous electric attacks to enemies in range.<br> <br> 

			·Voltaire's Frost Cannon<br> 
			Summon Mr. Voltaire with his cannon. Each time the cannon hits an enemy, it will add a "Frost" status, slowing movement speed and increasing crit chances from ice damage. "Frost" status can be stacked up to 5 times.<br> <br> 

			·Voltaire's E Turret<br> 
			Summon Mr. Voltaire to operate an electrical tower that will continuously attack nearby units, dealing a paralysis effect.<br> <br> 

			·Holo Projector<br> 
			Summon an illusion to assist in battle. The illusion's HP and attack values are a little lower than yours.<br> <br> 

			·Power Gauntlet<br> 
			A mysterious weapon left behind by Charlie's father. It charges up by absorbing treasure energy and fires a bolt of lightning once fully charged.<br> <br>
