                Treasure Hunters Racing Event Introduction</h3><br> <br> 
          <p style="font-size:.09rem;color:#834813;line-height:0.15rem;">

                There are some special events in Treasure Hunters, such as the Racing Game and Energy Crisis. The rewards are based on performance and the rules are a bit more complicated. Once hunters understand the rules and how to play, their chances of getting better rewards will be much greater. We will go into some more detail regarding these special events, in hope that more hunters will be able to enjoy the events! <br>  <br> 

                Level Restriction: Lvl 20 - 80 <br> 
                Event Type: Teams of 2 - 4 hunters <br> 
                Event Time: Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 20:15 to 21:00 <br> 
                The Racing Game is an event where players race to kill the boss. Hunters can team up in groups of 4 to challenge the event. Each day, 3 chances to enter this event are given to hunters and the best score of these 3 chances will be counted as the score for the day. <br> 
                It should be noted that the boss will have different characteristics each time this event is opened, so the team and playstyle should be adjusted each time to get the highest amount damage possible. <br> 
                 <br> 
                As above, the Pharaoh boss receives 15% more physical damage, so it would be a good idea for more teams to pick Mary to fight him. <br> 
                Below are the bosses that might appear: <br> 
                Pharaoh: receives 15% more physical damage. <br> 
                Hungry Mummy: receives 15% more fire damage. <br> 
                Don Carrotti's Coniglio Squad: shared HP pool. <br> 
                Don Carrotti: immune to crit damage. <br> 
                The boss must be defeated within 2 minutes. If hunters are unable to defeat the boss in that amount of time, then rewards will be given based on the percentage of the boss' HP that was damaged. Also, the team's damage dealt will be recorded in the rankings and players with higher rankings will earn more rare rewards. <br> 
                 <br>  <br> 
                So now you probably get the idea of the Racing Game... Bring more damage! But does that man you can 1st place by bringing 4 DPS hunters? The boss has 10 layers of HP, when the boss has 8 layers remaining, it will enter a frenzied state, and each layer destroyed after that will only increase its effects. After 1 layer of HP is destroyed while the boss is in a frenzy, its damage will be too much for any DPS hunter to bear. Therefore, it is recommended that the team has a reliable tank and healer to help the DPS characters survive longer. <br>
