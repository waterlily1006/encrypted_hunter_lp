          "Ruins Raid" Boss Hungry Mummy - Details</h3><br> <br> 
          <p style="font-size:.09rem;color:#834813;line-height:0.15rem;">
				
			Challenge Dungeons is Treasure Hunters' main co-op event. Hunters can choose from the "normal" or "elite" difficulties. Entries for normal dungeons refresh every day, and elite dungeon entries refreshes weekly. As players level up, they will unlock the 5 primary event types: Raid Ruins, Biochem Crisis, Phantom of the Castle, War Games, and Return of the Dead. Each event type contains 3 dungeon stages. The different styles and types of each dungeon will most certainly leave hardcore treasure hunters asking for more. After clearing each type of dungeon, hunters have a chance of receiving equipment fragments, elite equipment, and big rewards! Gather your fellow treasure hunters and use your combat skills and quick ingenuity to win honor for the team!<br> <br> 

			Next, we would like to introduce some tips for handling the toughest boss of the Ruins Raid—The Hungry Mummy. It is best to know your enemy after all...<br> <br> 

			The Hungry Mummy is the guardian of the Ruins of Rock. Its movements are slow, but it is very powerful and will use its massive body to crush intruders. Hunters, you must be quick to stop the Hungry Mummy from going into a frenzy!<br> <br> 

			Boss Skills and Strategy<br> <br> 

			Skill 1 Jump'n'smash<br> <br> 
			Skill Description: Hungry Mummy try to jump onto the target it hates the most from time to time, dealing insane damage when it lands.
			<br> <br> 
			Strategy:<br> 
			The skill has a large range and is impossible to dodge, not to mention its damage is quite high.<br> 
			The team needs to bring a tough tank to get the boss' attention and cause the boss to jump towards the tank and not other members.
			DPS and healing need to quickly move out of the range of that skill and shouldn't be standing near the tank at that time.<br> 
			After the skill is finished, the team's healer needs to quickly heal up any allies that took damage.<br> <br> 

			Skill 2 Super Spin<br> 
			Skill Description: When enemies are nearby, Hungry Mummy will start to spin, knocking others back.
			<br> <br> 
			Strategy:<br> 
			The team must maintain distance from the Hungry Mummy's to avoid triggering this skill.<br> 
			Hunters should also note that after the mummy leaps, they should be sure to get away from it quickly.<br> <br> 

			Skill 3 Earthquake<br> 
			Skill Description: Hungry Mummy slams the ground, knocking everyone into the air for a short time.<br> 
			<br> 
			Strategy:<br> 
			This skill is extremely fast and difficult to dodge, so it will require players to use their HP to take the hit.
			After the ability ends, the healer will have to help the team get back on its feet and recover HP.<br> <br> 

			Skill 4 Gravity Cyclone<br> 
			Skill Description: Hungry Mummy slap its chest and unleashes its power, drawing all enemies nearby it and spinning to hit them.
			<br> <br> 
			Strategy: the team must be outfitted with items to interrupt the mummy when it is casting this skill.<br> <br> 


			Stage 2 Missile Zombies<br> 
			Skill Description: after the mummy has been reduced below 50% HP, it will enter the 2nd stage and start launching missile zombies. These little zombies will target a treasure hunter and launch missiles that deal large AOE damage.
			<br> <br> 
			Strategy: concentrate firepower to eliminate the zombies and if a teammate is being targeted, other teammates should move away.
			<br> 
			Stage 3 Summon Monsters<br> 
			Skill Description: Hungry Mummy slap its chest and unleashes its power, drawing all enemies nearby it and spinning to hit them.
			<br> <br> 
			Strategy: the team must be outfitted with items to interrupt the mummy when it is casting this skill.
