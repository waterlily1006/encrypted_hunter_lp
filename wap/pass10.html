				"There is no mission impossible for me to complete!"<br> <br> 

				When she is wearing the cape, she is the rising star of the Hunters Society. No one knows her true identity because she always completes missions alone. Without the cape, she is a noble girl born into a rich family whose grandfather was once president of the Society. However, her grandfather was forced to quit that position because of the failure of Operation TS_07, and he never revealed the truth behind the incident. To restore her family's name, she has become a treasure hunter incognito and is on her own mission to investigate Operation TS_07.<br> 
				The Silver Seeker has a prideful attitude and despite her polite words, she quite enjoys patronizing others. Her work ethic covers up her frail heart and actually desires to be supported by others in the team. <br> <br> 

				Character Role<br> 
				Always equipped with a variety of medical items, Silver Seeker excels at healing other team members. Depending on different situations, Silver Seeker can choose between "buff build" for healing teammates and increasing their battle potential, or the "healing build," which increases survivability.
				When choosing the "buff build," Silver Seeker should primarily equip her Hand Cannon and Amphetamines. When she uses her hand cannon to attack enemies, it will leave behind a healing circle which heals nearby allies, essentially taking care of two birds with one stone. Amphetamines will greatly increase teammate's damage output for a short duration and are the signal for the team to concentrate their firepower on the enemy. In PvP, the Silver Seeker's survivability is her greatest weapon.
				When choosing the "healing build," Silver Seeker doesn't have any DPS capabilities, so it is typically a more PvE oriented build. Her MedGun has exponential healing capabilities compared to her Hand Cannon and can let her teammates focus on DPS without worrying about taking too much damage. MedBots and her other Meds can help strengthen her healing effects.<br> <br> 

				Character Weapons<br> 
				·Hand Cannon<br> 
				<br> 
				An elegant and noble weapon that uses special bullets capable of damaging the enemy while healing her allies. However, it is said that the only difference between these bullets and others is that they added some tea powder inside???<br> <br> 

				·MedGun<br> 
				<br> 
				The MedGun shoots out a healing wave that can heal multiple allied units simultaneously. Please note that the MedGun has no damage effect on the enemy.<br> <br> 

				Character Items<br> 
				·Energy Grenade<br> 
				<br> 
				It was once thought that there was little purpose for such a weak grenade, but it instead has found its place among medics on the battlefield. These grenades are capable of flying far at a slow speed, dealing a set amount of damage to enemies hit along the way.<br> <br> 

				·MedBots
				<br> <br> 
				Summon a MedBot and it will automatically lock onto and follow the most wounded ally, leaving you carefree until daybreak.<br> <br> 

				·EM Shield<br> 
				<br> 
				The whole team will gain a layer of shields for a short duration and movement speed will be greatly increased.<br> <br> 

				·Meds
				<br> <br> 
				Silver Seeker will create an AOE healing effect, quickly healing all allies within range.<br> <br> 

				·Grav Grenade: tosses a Grav Grenade, which creates a mini-black hole at the point of impact, gradually pulling enemies inward.<br> 
				<br> 

				·Amphetamines<br> 
			<br> 
				With the support of the Society's biggest star, the entire team becomes excited and changes their attack patterns, greatly increasing their attack power.
