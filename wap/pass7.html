         Drake</h3><br> <br> 
          <p style="font-size:.09rem;color:#834813;line-height:0.15rem;">
				
				"Did you just try to touch my butt?!"<br> <br> 

				Appearing to be just the average unreliable womanizer wearing a woman's cowboy hat, Drake is actually an S level Society hunter! Deep down though, he seems to be keeping some important matter to himself.<br> 
				On the way to the City of Hunters, the transport that Charlie was riding on came under attack from the Plunder Platoon. Luckily, Drake was also riding that transport, who then used his experience to help command Charlie in battle, defeating the Plunder Platoon attackers. It didn't take long for Drake's unreliable side to become apparent, but Charlie continued to help him through a slew of challenges together. After exposing the Plunder Platoon's plot to bring about the Fall of Civilization, not only did facts about Drake's past begin to surface, Charlie was able to find more clues regarding his father...<br> <br> 

				Character Role<br> 
				Drake is considered the team's tank, soaking up most of the incoming damage with his huge HP and defense. His Adrenaline and Exoskeleton equipment ensure his survivability while his Smash Hammer effectively controls enemy bosses and disrupts enemy DPS.<br> 
				When training Drake to be a tank, hunters should focus on increasing his HP, DEF, and elemental resistance. Remember to prioritize these three attributes when modifying items as well. Of course, attack and movement speed should also be taken into consideration when preparing Drake for PvP game modes.<br> <br> 


				Character Weapons<br> 
				To let Drake's ability to absorb damage really shine, hunters can try equipping Drake's Shotgun or Heavy Machinegun as a weapon together with items like Rocket Boots, Smash Hammer, Adrenaline, Exoskeleton, and Chainsaw Tornado.<br> 
				·Shotgun: A weapon that tears through enemies at close range. Combined with Drake's undeniably good looks, your enemies will most certainly despise you.<br> 
				·Heavy Machineguns: Guns that put out massive single-target damage and makes iron walls look like paper! The one minor setback is that movement speed is slowed when attacking, and healing takes more time.<br> <br> 

				·Rocket Boots: Use the speed of your rocket boots to blast forward, dealing massive damage to any enemies hit along the way.<br> 
				·Smash Hammer: swing your massive hammer into the ground, stunning nearby units and dealing a set amount of damage.<br> 
				"·Adrenaline: believe in the miracles of overwhelming strength and receive a metal body<br> 
				for a short time. The moment you transform, nearby enemies will be knocked back, your bullets will be more effective, and you will receive a large amount of HP for a short duration.<br> 
				·Heroic Leap: Drake jumps high into the air and then smashes into the specified location, dealing high damage and increasing Drake's DEF."<br> 
				·Exoskeleton: summons an outer shell and deals large AOE damage each time Drake smashes the ground. Drake's Exoskeleton can help him absorb a large amount of damage.<br> 
				·Chainsaw Tornado: Drake starts spinning with a chainsaw until he becomes like a tornado, dealing AOE damage and disrupting nearby enemies.<br>
