          World Territories Introduction</h3><br> <br> 
<p style="font-size:.09rem;color:#834813;line-height:0.15rem;">
Ark of Wonders<br>
The moving capital of the Treasure Raiders Society has special privileges, allowing it to be able to fly over any country. The Ark of Wonders is the place where hunters accept missions, exchange information, and rest to prepare for the next mission. It is said that the ark is the earliest location of the Society's headquarters. To this day, aspiring hunters must first complete the mission of "Finding the Ark of Wonders" to enroll as a hunter. It can be said that the Ark of Wonders is where all hunters' dreams begin.
Mission Area<br>
Hunters can accept a variety of missions from the Society Counter, the pool on the forward deck is for relaxing, and mysterious missions can be accepted from the cold, scary girl near the bow.<br><br>
Dispatch Area<br>
Here, hunters must request permission to dispatch from Captain Aran, who provides assault ships to carry hunters to the mission areas. You may also purchase Arena Tickets from the Arena Counter on the lower deck located near the side of the ship, allowing you to participate in a series of Arena events.
Commercial Area<br>
Not only can you find Dr. Lucky, the weapons and items manufacturer here, you can also find the girl who only arrived on the Ark of Wonders a short time ago that has already become everyone's idol, Lilly. Listening to the gripes of middle-aged men might give you more useful information than you'd expect. From below the Commercial Area's deck, you can enter the Hunter Lodge, which is restricted to Hunter Troupe members.<br>
Hunter Lodge<br><br>
Sit down for a drink and spend the afternoon sharing information with other treasure hunters. This is the Hunter Lodge, an exclusive place for Troupe members where many aspects of the hunter life wait to be discovered by you.<br><br>

Ruins of Rock<br>
A tomb administered by the Pharaoh Rock III. Rock III has been awakened by the Ancient World to act as an "agent," taking charge of the treasures inside this tomb. He is currently working hard with his band to become famous as a lead singer and rock guitarist.<br>
In the Ruins of Rock area, not only can you enjoy the authentic desert climate, you can also magnificent and mysterious remnants of the ancient civilization. But you must be careful not to disturb the chaotic inhabitants here who have no way to vent their anger other than eating you.<br><br>

Harry Boddom's Laboratory<br>
This is the laboratory of the treasure energy scientist, Harry Boddom. He is sort of like the Tony Stark of the Treasure Raiders world!
However, the laboratory seems to have taken a strange turn, as sightings of groups of unidentified people have been sighted around the lab. The doctor known for working in solitude has curiously been replaced by long-winded, frowning lab assistants. Vine can be seen growing from the lab's windows, along with tentacles that cordially spray poison as they wave at you passing by.<br><br>

Dracula's Castle<br>
The recommended expedition point in Hunter Weekly appears to only be an old, run-down manor. However, after crossing the cemetery and pumpkin patches in front of the castle, perhaps another world is waiting for you inside?!<br>
It's good to have the spirit of adventure, of course, but as a guest, you must be careful of your manners and mindful of the master. You wouldn't want anything bad to happen if there is no way to leave the house until dawn...<br>
