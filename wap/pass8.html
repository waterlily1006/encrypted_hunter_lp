				“ヾ (o ° ω ° O ) ノ”<br> 
				Harry Boddom was originally an expert on treasure research, both rich and handsome, and quite the playboy. But after his arch rival managed to find a way to transform him into a baby, he began to reflect back on his life. As a single, 10 month old baby, Harry pilots a mech that he created and has now become a treasure hunter, looking for a way to return to his former self.<br> <br> 

				Character Role<br> 
				Dr. Harry is able to switch between DPS and DEF capabilities. His tough mech provides him with reliable survivability and he has various items to help bolster his defense, allowing him to charge ahead of the team. At the same time, Harry can use close-range flamethrowers or long range rifles to dish out DPS. Harry is a well-rounded tank and damage dealer.<br> <br> 

				"Defense Line" allows Harry to deal consistent and considerable DPS, and his heat-seeking rockets will definitely upset the enemy. Coupled with Harry's blinding Flashbang and high DEF, high definitely serves an important role on the battlefield. In PvP, his survivability and versatility give him considerable combat potential.
				The "Damage Build" primarily consists of the flamethrower's AOE damage. Similar to how Charlie can use ice or electrical damage, Dr. Boddom can use fire elemental damage to add a burning effect to the enemy. Along with items like Fuel Thrower, Air Support, etc., playing as Dr. Boddom will give the satisfying feeling of bombarding the enemy with damage. In PvP, be sure to level up the burning effects for powerful results.<br> <br> 

				Character Weapons<br> 
				·Akimbo Rifles<br> 
				<br> 
				A steady and reliable single-target DPS weapon that can shoot at range. This weapon is capable of dealing with any situation and is the first pick for hunters that like a good fight!<br> <br> 

				·Flamethrowers<br> 
				<br> 
				A lethal weapon that was rebuilt from tools to get rid of insects, capable of dealing massive damage to large numbers of enemies at close range. Remember, you must get closer...<br> <br> 

				Character Items<br> 
				·Flashbang<br> <br> 
				
				A modified form of the flashbang grenade used by police forces that blinds affected units. Who woulda guessed that even robot dog eyes made of titanium alloy can be blinded...<br> <br> 

				·Frag Shield<br> <br> 
				
				Generate a shield to block damage for yourself that explodes either upon taking too much damage or when its time limit is reached, dealing damage to nearby enemies.<br> <br> 

				·Ring of Fire: Spray a penetrating type of fire on nearby enemies that continues burning until the end.<br> <br> 

				·Missile Array<br> <br> 
			
				Fire seeker missiles from the Missile Array located on Dr. Boddom's mecha that follow any enemy with a heat signature and fry them to a crisp.<br> <br> 

				·Defensive Force Field<br> 
				<br> 
				Casts a force field around the user that bounces back any enemies that draw near to it. Allies within the force field will receive a set amount of damage reduction.<br> <br> 

				·Air Support<br> 
				<br> 
				Failing to stop the Fall of Civilization caused the Society to greatly increase support for its treasure hunters. Simply call the Society for support to bombard the area in front of you.
